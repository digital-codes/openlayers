title: Tiled Layer Rendering in an Offscreen Canvas
shortdesc: Simplified example of a tiled layer strategy using a map that lives inside a worker.
docs: >
  The tiles of the map in this example are rendered in a web worker, using `OffscreenCanvas`. This can be improved by using a pool of workers to enable parallel, multi-threaded rendering.
